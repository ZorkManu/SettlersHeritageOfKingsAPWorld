# The Settlers Heritage Of Kings Archipelago Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Archipelago client for The Settlers Heritage Of Kings.

## Prerequisites

There are a lot of optional steps which could lead to errors if left out. These will later be tested and edited

1. The Settlers Heritage Of Kings installed on your computer:
*Currently my tests where on the cd (Gold Edition) but the History Edition (steam) might work aswell. Therefore the conversion guide is below in case the History Edition doesn't work. For the CD Version: It is important that you have the Legends Expansion so the Version sold on f.E. GoG doesnt suffice!*
3. Archipelago client installed

## Installation
1. Download the [archipelago maps](https://github.com/ZorkManu/ArchipelagoS5Mappack)
2. Go to {\extra2\maps\user\} and exctract the Mappack there
3. *optional* go into to {\Documents\DIE SIEDLER - DEdK\Data} or {\Documents\THE SETTLERS - HoK\Data} or {\Documents\The Settlers - Heritage of Kings\Data} and save the GDB.bin for the case anything breaks its good to have a backup (if your folder is named differently please message me so i can update the folder-list, I only have the german Documents folder)
4. Open the Legends Game and start the map __archipelago_init
5. Download the archipelago [fork](https://github.com/ZorkManu/Archipelago) *Currently the whole thing is needed since i dont have an exe of the launcher yet*
6. Open the Launcher *with python 3.11.9 or newer* and select your gamepath with /game_path. *It needs to be the main folder of your installation not a subfolder like bin*

## *optional*: Play with full screen window and HD Resolution
1. Download the mpupdater http://46.38.241.185:45001/share/MPUpdaterV4.zip (Link to the creators discord: https://discord.gg/b28BsKz)
2. Extract the files into your Settlers game folder
3. Start the mpupdater.exe (as admin if Settlers is installed in your programfiles) 
* NOTE: Some Antivirus Software will block the mpupdater.exe. This happens due to it being a fan hosted server connector, so open at your own risk *
4. Press on Fetch Diff and Update.
5. Now the archipelago launcher will start the game with borderless window resolution!

## *optional*: Convert your Steam (History) Edition to the Gold Edition (PC-CD Version) 
1. Download and unzip the S5Updater: https://github.com/mcb5637/S5Updater/releases/latest/download/Release.zip
2. Open the S5Updater.exe
3. Open the History Edition Path
4. Open a Folder where the Gold Edition should be installed to
5. Now you have a fresh installement of the Gold Edition!

## *optional*: Activate CppLogic (might be required for additional_attraction and additional_motivation)
1. Download and unzip the S5Updater: https://github.com/mcb5637/S5Updater/releases/latest/download/Release.zip
2. Open the S5Updater.exe
3. Press update CppLogic and mark the checkbox
